# Haikus for Codespaces

This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based on the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!

Also look on animated image effects in css from Nazar Pichak by following https://ominous-memory-9grq6546gxwhpj47-3000.app.github.dev/.

Point your browser to [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) for a tour of using Codespaces with this repo.
